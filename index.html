	<p>Whoooooaaaa – Vytautas Mineral Water</p>

	<p>It comes from the depths of earth, birds and fish haven’t had a chance to poop in it. It’s Poop-less, it’s clean, it’s full of minerals. () CI- it’s good for digestion, bricks, leather jackets, British cuisine, Icelandic cuisine and this goat on a boat which is probably a popular dish in Icelandic cuisine. Make yourself a sandwich out of pig and tow iPads, or that cocktail you’ve always wanted: The Recipe. One milk, one banana, one jet fighter, you knock from the sky with a crossbow. Whooooaaaa !~~ Vytautas gives you energy. Not unwanted body part. Use this energy for fun. Catch an electric eel and spin it so fast that it rips space and time continue and takes you to the future.</p>

	<p>[Stephen William Hawking, (8 January 1942)]</p>
	<p>Unfucking Unbelievable.</p>

	<p>If you’re not into time travels have a five-some. A dragon couple with some sex is a breeze now. Or same sex, I don’t care. OOOOHHHH!~ You’ll be sexy like Tiger in a Bugatti, powered by liquified thoughts about size of the UNIVERSE. Hard to comprehend? Well, not anymore. Minerals in Vytautas are good for your brain too. Your witts will be so sharp you’ll be able to slay vampires with them. Hey Edward! Knock Knock! It’s good for you luck too. Vytautas will drastically reduce your chances of seeing these things: (crocs, empty toliet roll, wasp, fat ass Cellulite, doctor/dentist) and being raped by a gang of Pandas. Not afraid of Pandas but having other stresses. (Mg Magnesium 12 / 24) Magnesium will manage that, there are two way of living: Giving a fuck. Not Giving a fuck. Drink Vytautas and give a NEGATIVE FUCK.</p>

	<p>[Stephen Hawking]</p>
	<p>Giving a negative fuck can destroy the universe as we know it.</p>

	<p>I don’t care; I wonder how it tastes like: take a greasy (life’s shit) teenager and an Eastern European builder and three random animals and then put them all into a hot jacuzzi of horse sweat for 2 Hours. After 7 days of fermentation ( ) says: will taste better than Vytautas. So it’s not for pussies to see, it’s for MEN who can handle raw awesomeness of minerals —– is that a colossal bear squeezing Earth juice, Vytautas Is Earth’s Juice. FUCK YEAH! Try it on your tractor. (Dubstep Music Plays) Now Choose: Boobs or Cheese? Smart Choice, You Choose Boobs, You choose Earth Juice. They’re equally good. Vytautas Mineral Water. It kills hangovers, it’s good for you. It’s Earth’s Juice. Oh look a kitten. *meow*</p>

	<p>Call it Karma, call it god’s will but something bad might happen to you if you do this. Like one day you might be going down the street minding your own meaningless business, thinking about goals you’ll never achieve and then suddenly Bam! – Crazy runaway police horse kicks your hip-hop cap off your head and starts sexually harassing you. But then you wake up and you are like “Oh great, it was just a dream”. Then suddenly a voice – “Did you have a bad dream, honey?” You turn your head and there’s the same horse…. it wasn’t really a dream – it was a flashback. But kinda like a dream. Now you are married to that horse. Crazy runaway horse is your husband! And he doesn’t even love you. Or let you ride him. He rides you. If you know what I mean…</p>

	<p>Think twice before you rip the video and re-upload it.</p>
